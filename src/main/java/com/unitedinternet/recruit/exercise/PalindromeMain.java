/**
 * Write a program that outputs (STDOUT) numeric palindromes as a plain text list separated by a linefeed.
 *
 * A palindrome is something that when read from the left is the same as when read from the right.
 *
 * Examples for numeric palindromes are : 1, .., 88, 99, 101, 111, 121, ..., 25552, ....
 *
 * Output should start at 1. The upper limit for possible palindromes to check is passed in as a command line arg.
 *
 * With an upper limit of 1,000, the expected example output is:
 * 1
 * 2
 * ...
 * 989
 * 999
 *
 * That means you print all numerical palindromes between 1 and 1,000.
